## 🧱 System Architecture

1. **Medical Dataset**  
   - Contains symptoms and corresponding diagnoses.
   - Used for training the model.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handles missing values, duplicates, outliers.
   - Transforms categorical to numerical, normalizes data.

3. **Feature Vector Creation**  
   - Converts symptoms into structured numerical vectors.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms used: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

5. **Prediction Model Deployment**  
   - Model is saved and made ready for inference.

6. **User Input**  
   - Symptoms/test data collected via UI.

7. **Test Data Preprocessing**  
   - Ensures consistency with training data.

8. **Feature Vector Transformation**  
   - Converts test input into vector format.

9. **Prediction**  
   - Model infers likely disease based on input.

10. **Disease Output**  
    - Diagnosis displayed on Streamlit interface.
